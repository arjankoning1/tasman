\begin{samplecase}
{\bf n + Sn120: Total Monte Carlo}\newline

This is a sample case which demonstrates the principle of Total Monte Carlo. It also contains all particular features we
use to create covariance files for the TENDL library. With every random sample of parameters,  the random ENDF-6 file is retained for
TMC uncertainty propagation.
Below is the input file for ${}^{120}$Sn.

\VerbatimInput{\samples n-Sn120-tmc/org/tasman.inp}

Besides the uncertainty files mentioned in the previous sample cases, the important
covariance information is in the files starting with {\it var} (variance) and
{\it cov} (covariance). For example, {\it cov\_intra.ave} contains all covariance matrix
elements of cross sections correlated within the same reaction channel.
These files are read by another software package, TEFAL, for the production of
covariance files in nuclear data libraries.
