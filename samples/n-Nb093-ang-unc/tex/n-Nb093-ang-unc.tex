\begin{samplecase}
{\bf n + ${}^{93}$Nb: Experiment-weighted uncertainty calculation}\newline

In this sample case we add some more variation of the parameters and some more TASMAN features. The input file is as follows:

\VerbatimInput{\samples n-Nb093-ang-unc/org/tasman.inp}

Note that we have added angular distributions for the elastic channel and
first 4 inelastic levels. In the TASMAN part, we now perform 20 random
calculations, instead of the default 10, and to avoid starting with the
same results as sample case 1 we change the random seed. Moreover, we
request to save the results of all individual TALYS runs,
and output average + standard deviation files for angular distributions
and isomeric production.
Next, we have added variation of more OMP parameters and also a few level
density parameters. For 3 OMP and 3 level density parameters we overrule the
built-in variation by adding the relative standard deviation to the input
lines.
