\begin{samplecase}
{\bf n + ${}^{120}$Sn: Linear sensitivity analysis}\newline

In this sample case we create the sensitivity matrix of cross sections to model parameters. The input file is as follows:

\VerbatimInput{\samples n-Sn120-sens/org/tasman.inp}

Note that we have only include 10 parameters. If you want, you can paste parts of the TALYS output file {\it parameters.dat} to the end of
this input file, at the expense of waiting longer for the result of course.

Besides the standard TALYS output file, various files starting with 'sens' have been created:
\begin{itemize}
\item sensitivity files per reaction channel, e.g. {\it sens\_totalxs.tot, sens\_xs000000.tot}, etc. gives the sensitivity
per incident energy for each model parameter
\item sensitivity file per incident energy and tabulated per reaction channel {\it sensitivity.E} and averaged over all reaction channels
{\it sensitivity.Eave}
\item sensitivity file per reaction channel and incident energy and tabulated per parameter {\it sensitivity.xs} and averaged over all incident energies {\it sensitivity.xsave}.
\item sensitivity file per parameter and reaction channel and tabulated per incident energy {\it sensitivity.par} and averaged over all incident energies {\it sensitivity.parave}.
\item sensitivity per parameter averaged over all reaction channels and incident energies {\it sensitivity.all}.
\end{itemize}
To learn about a particular parameter sensitivity for a reaction channel at one incident energy I usually consult {\it sensitivity.xs}.
